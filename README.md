### Cycling Faculty
A faculty of a local university provides 8 bicycles for their students with three stands - the university and two different student housing locations in the city.

Play video to see it in action:

### Second city - Kezmarok
Community run system with about 10 bicycles in Kezmarok, Slovakia.

Demo
---------
[Whitebikes](http://whitebikes.info) - do not share your location if you are out of Bratislava, otherwise map will jump out of the bike share area.

How does it work?
---------
* No special bicycles required, any usable (mid-sized frame) bicycles will do
* No fixed stands required, stand positions are just marked for visibility
* Checks and balances included to prevent system abuse
* Free for all or charge users for rental time
